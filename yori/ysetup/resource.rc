//  NT 3.5 doesn't support DIALOGEX, and DIALOG appears to work correctly
//  including specifying a different font.  If DIALOGEX is needed for some
//  reason, we might need a seperate resource to support NT 3.5x.  That
//  would also remove the need to change fonts at runtime.
//
//  The dimensions of this dialog are system constrained.  260 is as high as
//  will fit on a 640x480 NT4 display.  380 is actually too wide for a
//  640x480 NT 3.x display, but the amount of cropping is tolerable and the
//  dialog is usable.
